# Medical Image Preprocessing and CNN Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for preprocessing medical images and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify or analyze the images. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing steps, and a basic CNN model setup.

## 📁 Contents

- `medical-image-preprocessing.ipynb`: Main notebook with step-by-step processing and model training.
- (Optional) Sample datasets or links to image data sources.

## 🧪 Features

- Read and visualize medical images  
- Preprocess image data (normalization, resizing, etc.)  
- CNN model creation using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Model training on a single image or dataset

## 🛠 Requirements

Install the following dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow opencv-python
```

You may also need:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-image-preprocessing.git
    cd medical-image-preprocessing
    ```

2. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook medical-image-preprocessing.ipynb
    ```

3. Run all cells to see the output and results.

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure you have the required image dataset in the correct path if working with local files.
- You may need to adjust image paths or preprocessing steps depending on your specific dataset.
